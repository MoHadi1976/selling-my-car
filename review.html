    <p>The Polo Match is Volkswagen’s equivalent of Ford’s Fiesta Zetec: slightly sportier than other models, but with touches of luxury (air conditioning is standard) as well. Examine it in detail and it’s remarkably close to the Moda model aimed at young drivers. It has the same gloss black door pillars and chromed grille trim, darkened rear windows and matt chrome interior detailing, and even the same colour choices. In fact, from the outside the only thing that separates the two is the style of the 15-inch alloy wheels, while inside it’s very similar, except that the Match has air conditioning as standard. Match is around £450 cheaper than the Moda with air-con, though, so it represents better value for money. It also has a better range of engines.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All the familiar Polo attributes are in place in the Match. It’s quiet, smooth-riding, comfortable, well-made and economical. Prices are extremely competitive, and secondhand values are as good as they get for a supermini. The 1.4-litre engine delivers a fine mix of performance and low fuel consumption, and is easily the pick of the three available. With the DSG gearbox it’s even more frugal, and you have the advantage of an automatic in town traffic or taking control yourself on open roads. Space and quality are exemplary, and with air conditioning as standard, Match provides pretty much an ideal spec. It’s well-priced too, especially when compared with the almost-identical Moda model</p>
